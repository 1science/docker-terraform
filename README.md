# What is Terraform?

![logo](logo.png)


Terraform provides a common configuration to launch infrastructure â€” from physical and virtual servers to email and DNS providers. 
Once launched, Terraform safely and efficiently changes infrastructure as the configuration is evolved.

Simple file based configuration gives you a single view of your entire infrastructure.

See: https://www.terraform.io/

# Usage

```
docker run -v ${PWD}:/app -w /app -it --rm 1science/terraform:0.13.7-python3.7 terraform plan  
```
